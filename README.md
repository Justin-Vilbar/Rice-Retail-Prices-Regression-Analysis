## Executive Summary

This research analyzes the primary drivers behind the retail prices of three major rice quality grades in the Philippines: **well-milled**, **regular-milled**, and **special-milled rice**. Using data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) spanning 2020 to 2023, the study employs multiple linear regression and correlation analysis to examine how factors such as harvest area, production volume, fertilizer application, geography (Regions I-V and CAR), and temporal trends influence market costs.

## Research Objectives

The study sought to answer four critical questions:

1. What is the overall relationship between agricultural factors (harvest area, production volume, fertilizer use, year, region) and rice prices? 


2. Can multiple linear regression models effectively predict rice retail prices? 


3. Which specific factors are the most significant predictors for each rice grade? 


4. How much of the total variation in rice prices can be explained by these statistical models?

## Methodology

The study utilized a Multiple Linear Regression Model (MLRM) represented by the following equation:

Variables Used 

* **Dependent Variables**: Retail prices of well-milled, regular-milled, and special-milled rice.
* **Independent Predictors**:
* Volume of production (metric tons)
* Area of palay harvested (hectares)
* Area of fertilizer applied (hectares)
* **Regional Dummies**: Regions II, III, IV-A, V, and CAR (Region I as base).
* **Temporal Dummies**: Years 2020, 2022, and 2023 (Year 2021 as base).

### Statistical Tools

Data was processed using **SAS (Statistical Analysis System)** software. Models were selected through automatic search procedures, including forward selection, backward elimination, and stepwise selection.

## Key Findings by Rice Grade

### 1. Well-Milled Rice

* **Significant Predictors**: Production volume, Regions II and III, and years 2020 and 2023.


* **Findings**: Production volume has a negative correlation with price, indicating that higher supply generally lowers retail costs.


* **Explanatory Power**: The model explains **94.09%** of price variations.

### 2. Regular-Milled Rice

* **Significant Predictors**: Harvested area, Regions III and V, and years 2022 and 2023.


* **Findings**: Harvested area has an inverse relationship with price. Regions III and V showed strong positive price effects.


* **Explanatory Power**: This model demonstrated the strongest explanatory power at **97.37%**.

### 3. Special-Milled Rice

* **Significant Predictors**: Fertilizer application area, Region V, CAR, and years 2020 and 2023.


* **Findings**: Fertilizer application is a key determinant, showing a positive correlation with price.


* **Explanatory Power**: The log-transformed model explains **87.55%** of price variations.

## Implications

* **Department of Agriculture (DA)**: The data offers a framework for designing regional price stabilization strategies and food security programs.


* **Farmers**: Insights can help optimize fertilizer use and production strategies to maximize economic returns.


* **Consumers**: Increased awareness of regional price trends and the factors influencing their staple food.
